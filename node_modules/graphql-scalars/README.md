## Thanks

This library was originally published as `@okgrow/graphql-scalars`. It was created and maintained by
the company `ok-grow`. We, The Guild, took over the maintenance of that library
[later on](https://the-guild.dev/blog/taking-over-merge-graphql-schemas).

We also like to say thank you to [@adriano-di-giovanni](https://github.com/adriano-di-giovanni) for
being extremely generous and giving us the `graphql-scalars` name on npm which was previously owned
by his own [library](https://github.com/adriano-di-giovanni/graphql-scalars).
