name: PHP - Asynchronous
logo: 
short-description:
key-objectives:
  - In asynchronous programming the functions are not executed in order. With asynchrony, we can interrupt the code to get some other information needed to continue execution. This means that the code waits for another part of the code and while it waits it executes the other parts.
  - Learning how to use sockets
  - Getting to know reactive programming libraries
  - Learning about coroutines
