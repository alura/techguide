short-description:
key-objectives:
  - Orientação a Objetos com Kotlin (Properties, Data class, Companion Objects, Delegation)
  - Kotlin is a cross-platform, object-oriented, functional, statically typed programming language. It compiles to the Java Virtual Machine and can also be translated to the JavaScript language and compiled to native code (via LLVM). It is the official language of Google's Android system.
  - Understanding its syntax
  - Knowing the primitive types
  - Declaring and using variables and constants
  - Using conditional structures (if, else)
  - Using repetition structures and loops (while, for)
  - Using functions, passing parameters and arguments
  - Implementing methods and reusing them
  - Null Safety (Eliminate the danger of null references)
  - Exceptions and Throwables
  - Coding conventions
  - Manipulating Collections, arrays and lists
  - Functional Paradigm Features
  - OOP with Kotlin (Properties, Data class, Companion Objects, Delegation)
