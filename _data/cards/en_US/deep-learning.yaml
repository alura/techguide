key-objectives:
  - Deep Learning is a branch of Machine Learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions of data using a deep graph with multiple processing layers, composed of various linear and nonlinear transformations.
  - Building and training models with Keras
  - Building and training models with Tensorflow
  - Selecting the layers of a model
  - Classifying images
  - Understanding the concepts of weights and biases
  - Neural networks for regression
  - Understanding the concept of recurrent networks
