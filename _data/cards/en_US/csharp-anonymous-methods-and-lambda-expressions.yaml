name: C# - Anonymous methods and lambda expressions
logo: 
short-description:
key-objectives:
  - Anonymous methods are unnamed methods that can be defined using the delegate keyword.
  - Lambda expressions are used like anonymous functions, but you don't need to specify the type of the value that you input, making them more flexible to use.
  - Creating anonymous functions that you can use to create delegates
  - Creating local functions that can be passed as arguments
