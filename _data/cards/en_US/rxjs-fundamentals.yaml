short-description:
key-objectives:
  - RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array methods (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.
  - Creating asynchronous programs
  - Creating event-based programs
  - Understanding the concept of observables and sequences of observables
  - Understanding how to use Observers, Subscription, Subject and others
