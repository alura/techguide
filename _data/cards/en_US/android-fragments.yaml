key-objectives:
  - A Fragment represents the behavior or a part of the user interface in a host Activity. You can combine multiple fragments into a single Activity to create a multi-panel UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities. You can imagine a fragment as a modular section of an Activity, which has its own life cycle, receives its own input events and can be added or removed during the execution of the Activity.
  - Understanding what a Fragment is
  - How to use and reuse Fragments in the same Activity
  - Understanding the reasons to use Fragments in Android projects
  - Implementing layouts with multiple panels
  - Migrating Android projects that only use Activities to use Fragments
  - Handling transactions from the fragment manager
