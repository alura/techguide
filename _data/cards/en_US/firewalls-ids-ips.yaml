name: Firewalls, IDS and IPS
logo: 
short-description:
key-objectives:
  - Definitions and differences between network security devices, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and intrusion detection systems (IDS). 
  - A firewall allows traffic depending on a set of rules that have been configured. It is based on source, destination and port addresses. A firewall can deny any traffic that does not meet the specified criteria.
  - IDS are passive monitoring system devices that monitor network traffic as it travels over the network, compare signature patterns, and trigger an alarm if suspicious activity or a known security threat is detected.
  - IPS is an active device that prevents attacks by blocking them.
