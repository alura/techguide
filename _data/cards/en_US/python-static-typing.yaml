name: Python - Static typing
logo: 
short-description:
key-objectives:
  - Python is a dynamically typed language, that is, there is no need to think about data types. Statically typed languages (such as C or Java) perform type checks upon compilation. It may feel safer, as you can immediately tell the type of parameter going into each function.
  - Getting to know type hinting
