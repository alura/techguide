key-objectives:
  - A hidden script can be malicious and difficult to detect with visual inspection during the script approval process. Visually review PowerShell scripts and use inspection tools to help detect suspicious script issues. These tools cannot always determine the intent of the PowerShell author, so they may draw attention to a suspicious script.
