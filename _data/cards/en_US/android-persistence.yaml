  - The concept of "data persistence" refers to ensuring that the information inputted into an application will be stored in a medium where it can be retrieved consistently. In other words, they are permanent records that are not lost when the session is closed.
  - In Android we can persistently store App-specific or shared files, primitive type information with preferences, and structured database data.
