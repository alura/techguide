key-objectives:
  - During the development of an app, it is quite common to have unexpected bugs, as well as a lack of understanding of the reason for the bug. To speed up the analysis and investigation of problems or unexpected behavior in the app, we need to learn how to debug an Android app.
  - Learning how to debug an app in Android Studio
  - Learning how to enable debugging on physical devices
  - Using logs to identify events
  - Analyzing stack tracks
  - Inspecting layout, system resources like processor, memory, and network
  - Debugging the app database and pre-compiled APK files
  - Analyzing the build with APK parser
