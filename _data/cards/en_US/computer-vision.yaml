key-objectives:
  - Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level knowledge from digital images or videos. From an engineering perspective, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.
  - Extracting regions of interest from an image
  - Normalizing and pre-processing image data
  - Building classifiers for face recognition
  - Extracting regions of the human face based on facial landmarks
  - Analyzing different conditions of each component of the human face
  - Using OpenCV
