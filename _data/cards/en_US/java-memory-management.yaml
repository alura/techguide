key-objectives:
  - In Java, memory management is the process of allocation and de-allocation of objects, called Memory management. Java does memory management automatically. Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector. Thus, we are not required to implement memory management logic in our application.
  - Understanding how memory and its management work in Java
  - Understanding how the Garbage Collector works
