short-description:
key-objectives:
  - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.
  - Creating web applications
  - Defining routes, redirects and templates
  - Validating forms
