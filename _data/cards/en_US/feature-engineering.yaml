key-objectives:
  - Feature engineering refers to the process of using domain knowledge to select and transform the most relevant variables from raw data when creating a predictive model using machine learning or statistical modeling, in order to improve the performance of Machine Learning algorithms.
  - Generating new variables from the available data
  - Transforming raw data into characteristics
  - Highlighting problems with predictive models
  - Improving model accuracy for new data
  - Selecting and creating features using Pandas and Scikit-learn libraries
