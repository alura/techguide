key-objectives:
  - Cloud, or cloud computing, is the distribution of computing services over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. A cloud is composed of various computing resources, ranging from the computers themselves (or instances, in cloud terminology) to networks, storage, databases, and everything around them. In other words, everything that is normally needed to set up the equivalent of a server room, or even a complete data center, will be ready to use, configured, and run.
  - Knowing the difference between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
  - Knowing the largest cloud providers
