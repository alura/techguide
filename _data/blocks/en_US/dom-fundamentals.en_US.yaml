  - The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
  - Understanding how the DOM tree works
  - Accessing and manipulating HTML and CSS elements
  - Accessing the parents and children of an element
  - Inserting a new element to the tree
  - Removing an element from the tree
  - Waiting for an event on a certain page element using addEventListener()
