short-description:
key-objectives:
  - Spring is an open source framework for the Java platform. It is a non-intrusive framework, based on the Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection design patterns. In Spring, the container is responsible for "instantiating" classes from a Java application and defining the dependencies between them through a configuration file in XML format, inferences from the framework, what is called auto-wiring, or even annotations on classes, methods and properties. This way, Spring enables low coupling between classes in an object-oriented application.
  - Understanding the concept of Dependency Injection
  - Understanding the MVC pattern
  - Using Spring Data to manipulate data
