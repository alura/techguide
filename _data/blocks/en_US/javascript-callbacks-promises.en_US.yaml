name: JavaScript - Callbacks and Promises
logo: 
short-description:
key-objectives:
  - A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods - instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
  - A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
  - An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.
  - Understanding the concept of asynchronous programming
  - Writing asynchronous code understanding the concept of promises in JavaScript
  - Using JavaScript methods, keywords and objects for handling promises like 'Async/Await', '.then()', 'Promise', etc
  - Learning in which situations you need to use asynchronous programming
  - Calling APIs with `fetch()`
