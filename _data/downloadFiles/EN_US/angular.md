# Angular
## Nivel 1
- [ ] **HTML - Fundamentals**:
   - HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
   - Learning which tags are required for basic HTML
   - Creating a text paragraph
   - Displaying an image
   - Knowing the difference between 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', etc.
   - Creating a hyperlinked text
   - Creating a form with relevant fields
   - Creating an ordered or unordered list of items
   - Creating a list of items within a dropdown list
   - Linking to a CSS file
   - Creating a table
   - Adding IDs and classes
- [ ] **CSS - Fundamentals**:
   - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.
   - Learning the visual structure of a page, with 'margin' and 'padding'
   - Establishing the size with 'width' and 'height'
   - Learning about the position of an element ('static', 'relative' or 'absolute')

- [ ] **Object-oriented Programming Concepts**:
   - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
   - How objects work
   - Creating and using constructors
   - What classes are
   - Creating and using Methods
   - How encapsulation works
   - What inheritance is
   - What polymorphism is
   - How interfaces work
   - What abstractions are
- [ ] **RxJS - Fundamentals**:
   - RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array methods (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.
   - Creating asynchronous programs
   - Creating event-based programs
   - Understanding the concept of observables and sequences of observables
   - Understanding how to use Observers, Subscription, Subject and others
- [ ] **Observer pattern**:
   - In software design, the Observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
   - Understanding what Design Patterns are
   - Updating several elements simultaneously using Observers
   - Declaring subjects
   - Creating event-based programs
## Nivel 2
- [ ] **Angular - Templates**:
   - In Angular, a template is a blueprint for a fragment of a user interface (UI). Templates are written in HTML, and special syntax can be used within a template to build on many of Angular's features.
- [ ] **Angular - Rendering**:
   - A normal Angular application executes in the browser, rendering pages in the DOM in response to user actions. Angular Universal executes on the server, generating static application pages that later get bootstrapped on the client.
   - Showing an Angular page on the browser
   - Performing Server-side rendering
- [ ] **Angular - Services**:
   - Service is a broad category encompassing any value, function, or feature that an application needs. A service is typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose. Angular distinguishes components from services to increase modularity and reusability.
   - Criar dados que estarão sempre disponíveis
   - Dividir a aplicação web em diversas partes
- [ ] **Angular - Routing**:
   - In a Single Page Application (SPA), all of your application's functions exist in a single HTML page. As users access your application's features, the browser needs to render only the parts that matter to the user, instead of loading a new page. This pattern can significantly improve your application's user experience. To define how users navigate through your application, you use routes. Add routes to define how users navigate from one part of your application to another. You can also configure routes to guard against unexpected or unauthorized behavior.
   - Navigating to a component
   - Including a route parameter
   - Controllung your user's navigation flow with route guarding
- [ ] **Angular - CLI (Command-Line Interface)**:
   - The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that you use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications directly from a command shell.
   - Learning the syntax 'ng [optional-arg] [options]'
   - Getting to know important commands, like 'ng add', 'ng build', 'ng update', 'ng deploy', 'ng new', 'ng test', among others
## Nivel 3
- [ ] **Angular - State Management**:
   - A 'state' is whatever data necessary in order to rebuild the UI at any moment in time. When this data change, it will trigger a redraw of the user interface. State management is the concept of adding, updating, removing and reading these data and their state in an application.
   - Updating components in real time
   - Waiting for changes in a component and performing changes
   - Using Redux, NGXS and others
- [ ] **Angular - Forms**:
   - A web form is an online page that allows for user input. It is an interactive page that mimics a paper document or form, where users fill out particular fields.
   - Creating forms with Template Forms
   - Creating reactive forms with Reactive Forms
- [ ] **Angular - Modules**:
   - A Module, unlike a Component, does not control any view. A Module consists of one or more Components. An Angular application must have at least one Module that contains at least one Component.
   - Using the ngModule class
   - Declaring which components can be used by components from other modules
   - Declaring which services will be injected
   - Learning how to modularize an application
   - Lazy-loading modules
- [ ] **Angular - Dependency Injection**:
   - Dependency Injection (DI) allows you to declare the dependencies of your TypeScript classes without taking care of their instantiation. Instead, Angular handles the instantiation for you. This design pattern allows you to write more testable and flexible code.
   - Declaring your classes' dependencies
   - Injecting dependencies into a Component
   - Getting to know Injection Tokens
   - Configuring providers
   - Understanding Hierarchical Dependency Injection
- [ ] **Angular - Testes**:

   - Using unit tests
   - Using integration testing
   - Using behavioral testing
   - Using mocks
   - Getting acquainted with Jasmine and/or Karma

   - Manipulating an object
- [ ] **Cloud - Fundamentals**:
   - Cloud, or cloud computing, is the distribution of computing services over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. A cloud is composed of various computing resources, ranging from the computers themselves (or instances, in cloud terminology) to networks, storage, databases, and everything around them. In other words, everything that is normally needed to set up the equivalent of a server room, or even a complete data center, will be ready to use, configured, and run.
