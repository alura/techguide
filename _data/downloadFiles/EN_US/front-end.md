# Front-end
## Nivel 1
- [ ] **HTML - Fundamentals**:
   - HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

- [ ] **CSS - Fundamentals**:
   - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

## Nivel 2
- [ ] **JavaScript - Callbacks and Promises**:
   - A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods - instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
   - A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
   - An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.
