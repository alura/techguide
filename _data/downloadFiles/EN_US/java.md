# Java
## Nivel 1
- [ ] **Java - Fundamentals**:
   - Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.

   - Manipulating arrays and lists
   - Getting data from an API
   - Making asynchronous 'Future' calls, etc
   - Creating constructors
- [ ] **Object-oriented Programming Concepts**:
   - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.

   - Learn the uses and differences between Equals and HashCode
   - Learn to work with ArrayList, LinkedList or Vector

   - Using unit tests
   - Using integration testing
   - Using behavioral testing
   - Using mocks
- [ ] **Java - Packages**:

   - Implementing the main data structures
## Nivel 2
- [ ] **JVM**:
   - The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a program that loads and runs Java applications, converting the bytecodes into machine-executable code. The JVM is responsible for managing the applications as they run. Thanks to the Java Virtual Machine, programs written in Java can run on any hardware and software platform that has a version of the JVM, thus making these applications independent of the platform they run on.

   - Understanding how memory and its management work in Java
   - Understanding how the Garbage Collector works
- [ ] **Spring Framework**:
   - Spring is an open source framework for the Java platform. It is a non-intrusive framework, based on the Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection design patterns. In Spring, the container is responsible for "instantiating" classes from a Java application and defining the dependencies between them through a configuration file in XML format, inferences from the framework, what is called auto-wiring, or even annotations on classes, methods and properties. This way, Spring enables low coupling between classes in an object-oriented application.
   - Understanding the concept of Dependency Injection

   - Getting to know the most popular Java build tools, such as Maven, Jenkins, Apache Ant, Gradle, etc., and how to use them
- [ ] **Java - Persistence**:
   - The concept of "data persistence" refers to ensuring that the information inputted into an application will be stored in a medium where it can be retrieved consistently. In other words, they are permanent records that are not lost when the session is closed.

   - Sending messages to a server and receive replies without querying the server
- [ ] **Java - Servlets**:
   - A servlet is a Java class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers. For such applications, Java Servlet technology defines HTTP-specific servlet classes.
