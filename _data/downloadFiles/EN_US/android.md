   - Orientação a Objetos com Kotlin (Properties, Data class, Companion Objects, Delegation)
   - Kotlin is a cross-platform, object-oriented, functional, statically typed programming language. It compiles to the Java Virtual Machine and can also be translated to the JavaScript language and compiled to native code (via LLVM). It is the official language of Google's Android system.

   - Creating an Android project with Android Studio and running it on a physical or virtual device
   - Knowing the jetpack libraries to ensure compatibility between Android versions
- [ ] **Object-oriented Programming Concepts**:
   - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.

- [ ] **Android - Fragments**:
   - A Fragment represents the behavior or a part of the user interface in a host Activity. You can combine multiple fragments into a single Activity to create a multi-panel UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities. You can imagine a fragment as a modular section of an Activity, which has its own life cycle, receives its own input events and can be added or removed during the execution of the Activity.

   - The concept of "data persistence" refers to ensuring that the information inputted into an application will be stored in a medium where it can be retrieved consistently. In other words, they are permanent records that are not lost when the session is closed.
   - In Android we can persistently store App-specific or shared files, primitive type information with preferences, and structured database data.

- [ ] **Kotlin - Asynchronous**:
   - In asynchronous programming, the functions are not executed in order. We can interrupt the code to get some other information needed to continue execution. This means that the code waits for another part of the code, and while it waits, it can execute the other parts.
   - Learning the possibilities to run code asynchronously on Android
   - Getting to know the java.concurrent package and its solutions
   - Using Coroutines as a solution for asynchronous code in Kotlin

- [ ] **Kotlin - Communication with APIs**:
   - An API is an interface that software developers use to programmatically interact with software components or resources outside of their own code. An even simpler definition is that an API is the part of a software component that is accessible to other components.
   - Performing HTTP requests to communicate with online services such as REST API is fundamental to most Android apps. As such, it is important to know the main tools and techniques needed for this type of functionality.

   - Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external sources instead of creating them.
   - When writing code in Android projects, it is often the case that a feature uses library code, such as Room to save data or Retrofit to make requests to the REST API. These libraries are known as dependencies in our codes, precisely because of their necessity to perform the expected action. Using these libraries easily anywhere in the app can have its challenges, such as providing unique instances and performing all the necessary configuration for correct operation. For this, we use dependency injection tools that make our job easier.
