</ul></li><li><span class="checkbox-wrapper"><input disabled="" type="checkbox"></span> <strong>Object-oriented Programming Concepts</strong>:</li>
<ul><li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of &#39;objects&#39;, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

</ul></li><li><span class="checkbox-wrapper"><input disabled="" type="checkbox"></span> <strong>Android - Fragments</strong>:</li>
<ul><li>A Fragment represents the behavior or a part of the user interface in a host Activity. You can combine multiple fragments into a single Activity to create a multi-panel UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities. You can imagine a fragment as a modular section of an Activity, which has its own life cycle, receives its own input events and can be added or removed during the execution of the Activity.</li>

<li>Learning about the different types of permissions</li>
<li>Special permissions</li>
<li>Best practices</li>
</ul></li><li><span class="checkbox-wrapper"><input disabled="" type="checkbox"></span> <strong>Kotlin - Asynchronous</strong>:</li>
<ul><li>In asynchronous programming, the functions are not executed in order. We can interrupt the code to get some other information needed to continue execution. This means that the code waits for another part of the code, and while it waits, it can execute the other parts.</li>

<ul><li>An API is an interface that software developers use to programmatically interact with software components or resources outside of their own code. An even simpler definition is that an API is the part of a software component that is accessible to other components.</li>
<li>Performing HTTP requests to communicate with online services such as REST API is fundamental to most Android apps. As such, it is important to know the main tools and techniques needed for this type of functionality.</li>

<li>Learning what these features are and how to use them</li>
</ul></li><li><span class="checkbox-wrapper"><input disabled="" type="checkbox"></span> <strong>Kotlin - Dependency Injection</strong>:</li>
<ul><li>Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external sources instead of creating them.</li>
<li>When writing code in Android projects, it is often the case that a feature uses library code, such as Room to save data or Retrofit to make requests to the REST API. These libraries are known as dependencies in our codes, precisely because of their necessity to perform the expected action. Using these libraries easily anywhere in the app can have its challenges, such as providing unique instances and performing all the necessary configuration for correct operation. For this, we use dependency injection tools that make our job easier.</li>
<li>Learning how to use the dependency injection technique and one of the most common Android tools for this - Hilt, Dagger or Koin</li>
</ul></li><li><span class="checkbox-wrapper"><input disabled="" type="checkbox"></span> <strong>Android - Testing</strong>:</li>

<li>Using unit tests</li>
<li>Using integration testing</li>
<li>Using instrumented testing</li>
<li>Using mocks to facilitate test implementation with dependencies</li>
<li>Implementing tests with Dependency Injection tools such as Hilt</li>

</ul></li><li><span class="checkbox-wrapper"><input disabled="" type="checkbox"></span> <strong>Android - Core App quality</strong>:</li>
<ul><li>When writing an Android App, there are a number of requirements to ensure an expected quality, such as compatibility of the App with the navigation expected by the Android system, or the gestures, etc.</li>
<li>The requirements are classified as - Visual experience, Functionality, Performance and stability, Privacy and security, Google Play, and Testing procedure</li>
<li>Fulfilling all or almost all requirements means that the App has a higher quality for the users</li>
</ul></li><li><span class="checkbox-wrapper"><input disabled="" type="checkbox"></span> <strong>Android - CI/CD</strong>:</li>
<ul><li>CI/CD is short for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery. It is a software development practice that aims to make code integration more efficient through automated builds and testing.</li>
