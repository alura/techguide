# React
## Nivel 1
- [ ] **HTML - Fundamentals**:
   - HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
   - Learning which tags are required for basic HTML
   - Creating a text paragraph
   - Displaying an image
   - Knowing the difference between 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', etc.

- [ ] **CSS - Fundamentals**:
   - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.
   - Learning the visual structure of a page, with 'margin' and 'padding'
   - Establishing the size with 'width' and 'height'
   - Learning about the position of an element ('static', 'relative' or 'absolute')
   - Learning about the display of an element ('block', 'inline', 'inline-block')
   - Learning how to position images in relation to text
   - Learning about alignment
   - Learning about font style

   - Learning box-sizing
   - Learning Flexbox
   - Learning Grid
- [ ] **JavaScript - Fundamentals**:
   - JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language and is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.

- [ ] **DOM - Fundamentals**:
   - The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

- [ ] **SPA Concepts**:
   - A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.
   - Understanding what an SPA is
   - Establishing routes to other pages
   - Knowing SPA frameworks
   - Communicating with APIs
- [ ] **HTML - Fundamentals**:
   - HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

   - Cypress is a front-end testing tool that allows for setting up, writing, running, and debugging tests.
- [ ] **JavaScript - Callbacks and Promises**:
   - A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods - instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
   - A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
   - An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

- [ ] **Service Workers**:
   - Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercept network requests and take appropriate action based on whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.

   - Cloud, or cloud computing, is the distribution of computing services over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. A cloud is composed of various computing resources, ranging from the computers themselves (or instances, in cloud terminology) to networks, storage, databases, and everything around them. In other words, everything that is normally needed to set up the equivalent of a server room, or even a complete data center, will be ready to use, configured, and run.
   - Knowing the difference between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
   - Knowing the largest cloud providers
   - Specializing in a specific provider of your choice
- [ ] **YARN**:
   - Yarn is a package manager for your code. It allows you to use and share code with other developers. Code is shared through something called a package (sometimes referred to as a module). A package contains all the code being shared as well as a package.json file which describes the package.
