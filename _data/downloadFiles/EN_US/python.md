# Python
## Nivel 1
- [ ] **Python - Fundamentals**:
   - Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used in web applications, software development, data science, and machine learning. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.

   - Knowing the comparison operators
   - Using repetition structures and loops ('while', 'for')
   - Using functions, passing parameters and arguments
   - Manipulating methods
   - Manipulating arrays and lists
   - Getting data from an API
   - Creating constructors
- [ ] **Object-oriented Programming Concepts**:
   - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
   - How objects work
   - Creating and using constructors
   - What classes are
   - Creating and using Methods
   - How encapsulation works
   - What inheritance is
   - What polymorphism is
   - How interfaces work

- [ ] **Data Structures**:
   - In the context of computers, the data structure is a specific way of storing and organizing data in the computer's memory so that these data can be easily retrieved and efficiently used when needed later.
   - Knowing the main data structures (linked list, stack, queue, tree, etc)
   - Implementing the main data structures
- [ ] **Python - Collections**:
   - A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements. They are like containers that group multiple items into a single unit. Some collections allow duplication of elements and some do not. Some are ordered and some are unordered.
   - Using lists and tuples
   - Using polymorphism in collections
   - Using sets and dictionaries
- [ ] **Python - Testing**:
   - Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.
   - Using unit tests
   - Using integration testing
   - Using behavioral testing
   - Using mocks
- [ ] **Python - Communication with APIs**:
   - An API is an interface that software developers use to program interaction with software components or features outside their own code. An even simpler definition is that an API is the part of a software component that is accessible to other components.

   - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.
   - Creating web applications
   - Defining routes, redirects and templates

- [ ] **Python - Lambdas and Closures**:
   - Lambda functions are nothing more than anonymous functions. While normal functions can be created using def as a prefix, lambda functions are created using lambda.
   - A closure in Python is an inner function object, a function that behaves like an object, that remembers and has access to variables in the local scope where it was created, even after the outer function has finished executing. It can also be defined as a means of binding data to a function without passing it as a parameter.
## Nivel 3

   - Using lazy evaluation
   - Running concurrent tasks
   - Using the reserved word 'yield'
- [ ] **Python - Asynchronous**:
   - In asynchronous programming, the functions are not executed in order. We can interrupt the code to get some other information needed to continue execution. This means that the code waits for another part of the code, and while it waits, it can execute the other parts.
   - Learning about coroutines
   - Coroutines are a generalization of subroutines. They are used for cooperative multitasking where a process yields control voluntarily, periodically or when idle, in order to allow multiple applications to run simultaneously.
   - Dealing with concurrency
   - Knowing the concept of waitable objects
   - Creating concurrent tasks

- [ ] **Python - args & kwargs**:
   - The magic variables *args and **kwargs are commonly used in function definitions, and are used to pass an unknown number of arguments to a function.
   - Understanding the difference between *args and **kwargs
- [ ] **Python - Dunder methods**:
   - Special methods or magic methods in Python are methods that are predefined in all objects, with automatic invocation under special circumstances. They are usually not called directly by the user but can be overloaded (overwritten and changed). Their names begin and end with double underscores called 'dunder' (an expression derived from double underscore).
   - Understanding the concept of special (or magic) methods
   - Knowing the main magic methods and how to use them
- [ ] **Python - Metaprogramming**:
   - Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.
   - Writing a program that manipulates other programs
   - Using metaclasses

   - Cloud, or cloud computing, is the distribution of computing services over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. A cloud is composed of various computing resources, ranging from the computers themselves (or instances, in cloud terminology) to networks, storage, databases, and everything around them. In other words, everything that is normally needed to set up the equivalent of a server room, or even a complete data center, will be ready to use, configured, and run.

- [ ] **Clean Architecture**:
   - Clean architecture is a way of developing software, such that just by looking at the source code of a program, you should be able to tell what the program does.
- [ ] **Design Patterns**:
   - In software engineering, a Design Pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
