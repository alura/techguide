## Nivel 1
- [ ] **C# - Fundamentals**:
   - C# is a multi-paradigm, strongly typed programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET platform. The source code is compiled into Common Intermediate Language (CIL) which is interpreted by the Common Language Runtime (CLR) virtual machine. It is designed to run on the Common Language Infrastructure of the .NET Framework platform.

   - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
