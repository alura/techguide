# Cybersecurity
## Level 1

### Cryptography - Fundamentals:
- Cryptography in cybersecurity is the conversion of data from a readable format into an encrypted format. Encrypted data can only be read or processed after it has been decrypted.

### Cybersecurity Framework:
- The Cybersecurity Framework is a guidance guide for organizations - in any industry or community - that seek to improve cybersecurity risk management through the use of Frameworks. While the Cybersecurity Framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach to managing cybersecurity risks for organizations, it ultimately aims to reduce and better manage those risks. As such, this guide is intended for any and all organizations, regardless of industry or size.

### Firewalls, IDS and IPS:
- Definitions and differences between network security devices, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and intrusion detection systems (IDS).
- A firewall allows traffic depending on a set of rules that have been configured. It is based on source, destination and port addresses. A firewall can deny any traffic that does not meet the specified criteria.
- IDS are passive monitoring system devices that monitor network traffic as it travels over the network, compare signature patterns, and trigger an alarm if suspicious activity or a known security threat is detected.
- IPS is an active device that prevents attacks by blocking them.

### Web application - Vulnerability:
- Web application vulnerabilities involve a system flaw or weakness in a web-based application. They have existed for years, largely due to failure to validate or clean form entries, misconfigured web servers, and application design flaws, and can be exploited to compromise the security of the application. These vulnerabilities are not the same as other common types of vulnerabilities, such as network or asset. They arise because web applications need to interact with multiple users on multiple networks, and this level of accessibility is easily exploited by hackers.

### Container Security:
- Container security is the process of combining security policies to ensure that the integrity of the container is protected. Container security is important because the container image contains all the components that will eventually run your application. If there are vulnerabilities lurking in the container image, the risk and potential severity of security problems during production increases.
