# Cybersecurity
## Nivel 1
- [ ] **Cryptography - Fundamentals**:
   - Cryptography in cybersecurity is the conversion of data from a readable format into an encrypted format. Encrypted data can only be read or processed after it has been decrypted.
- [ ] **Cybersecurity Framework**:
   - The Cybersecurity Framework is a guidance guide for organizations - in any industry or community - that seek to improve cybersecurity risk management through the use of Frameworks. While the Cybersecurity Framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach to managing cybersecurity risks for organizations, it ultimately aims to reduce and better manage those risks. As such, this guide is intended for any and all organizations, regardless of industry or size.
- [ ] **Hacker Techniques**:
   - Understanding the methodologies and techniques attackers use to perform reconnaissance as a pre-attack step, including how they use open source intelligence, network scanning, and target enumeration attacks to find the gaps in their network security.
   - Using attacker techniques to assess the security of a target network, evaluating popular protocols and endpoints for Windows, Linux, and cloud destinations.
- [ ] **Vulnerability assessment**:
   - Framework techniques and tactics from various services and tools that provide a vulnerability scanning and management solution.
- [ ] **Firewalls, IDS and IPS**:
   - Definitions and differences between network security devices, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and intrusion detection systems (IDS).
   - A firewall allows traffic depending on a set of rules that have been configured. It is based on source, destination and port addresses. A firewall can deny any traffic that does not meet the specified criteria.
   - IDS are passive monitoring system devices that monitor network traffic as it travels over the network, compare signature patterns, and trigger an alarm if suspicious activity or a known security threat is detected.
   - IPS is an active device that prevents attacks by blocking them.
- [ ] **Digital Investigation - Fundamentals**:
   - Digital Investigation is the use of science to investigate digital crimes and determine facts, which has emerged from the use and spread of digital systems such as computers and smartphones.
- [ ] **Password attack**:
   - In cryptanalysis and security, password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored or transmitted by a computer system in encrypted form. A common approach (brute force attack) is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and compare them with an available cryptographic hash of the password.
- [ ] **Open-Source Intelligence**:
   - OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) can be defined as a set of activities to collect, store and analyze information from public sources, basically any data about a company or person that can be found through Internet tools or OSINT frameworks, such as search engines.
- [ ] **Security Operations Center**:
   - SOC (Security Operations Center) is the department that comes to plan and support the entire I.T. security strategy, monitoring, preventing, and remedying breaches, failures, and possible attacks, all in a proactive way.
- [ ] **Penetration Testing - Fundamentals**:
   - Pentest (Penetration Testing) is the practice of testing a computer system, network, or Web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker might exploit, simulating an attack against an organization's IT assets.
## Nivel 2

   - Endpoint security, or endpoint protection, is the cybersecurity approach to defending endpoints such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices against malicious activity.
- [ ] **Metasploit - Attack and Analysis**:
   - Metasploit is the world's most widely used penetration testing framework.
- [ ] **Web application - Security**:
   - Web application security (also known as Web AppSec) is the idea of designing websites to function as expected, even when under attack. The concept involves a collection of security controls designed into a web application to protect its assets from potentially malicious agents.
- [ ] **Web application - Vulnerability**:
   - Web application vulnerabilities involve a system flaw or weakness in a web-based application. They have existed for years, largely due to failure to validate or clean form entries, misconfigured web servers, and application design flaws, and can be exploited to compromise the security of the application. These vulnerabilities are not the same as other common types of vulnerabilities, such as network or asset. They arise because web applications need to interact with multiple users on multiple networks, and this level of accessibility is easily exploited by hackers.
- [ ] **Mobile Device Management**:
   - Mobile device management refers to any tool or software designed to help administrators control and secure mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets in an organization. Mobile device management is an important part of enterprise mobility management and endpoint management, especially as more companies adopt BYOD (bring your own device) policies that allow employees to access company data, files, and applications on their personal devices.

- [ ] **Cloud forensics**:
   - Investigating data stored in the cloud can be a variety of approaches, from open source intelligence investigations (OSINT) to investigations of cloud accounts of participating individuals who disclose their login credentials (more often from victims and witnesses than suspects), to obtaining and analyzing collateral returns from cloud service providers to gain access to suspects' accounts.
- [ ] **Data Recovery**:
   - Data recovery is a software-driven process that allows you to recover and restore lost, deleted, inaccessible, corrupted, or damaged files so that you can get back to work quickly. As the business landscape, and our lives in general, become more dependent on data, the need to protect data systems is growing.
- [ ] **Container Security**:
   - Container security is the process of combining security policies to ensure that the integrity of the container is protected. Container security is important because the container image contains all the components that will eventually run your application. If there are vulnerabilities lurking in the container image, the risk and potential severity of security problems during production increases.
- [ ] **Memory forensics**:
   - Memory forensics (sometimes called memory analysis) refers to the analysis of volatile data in a computer's memory dump. Information security professionals perform memory forensics to investigate and identify attacks or malicious behavior that do not leave easily detectable traces on the hard drive data.
- [ ] **Network forensics**:
   - Network forensics refers to the collection, monitoring, and analysis of network activities to discover the source of attacks, viruses, intrusions, or security breaches that occur on a network or in network traffic. As such, network forensics is considered along with mobile forensics or digital image forensics as residing under the umbrella of digital forensics.
- [ ] **PowerShell scripting for security**:
   - A hidden script can be malicious and difficult to detect with visual inspection during the script approval process. Visually review PowerShell scripts and use inspection tools to help detect suspicious script issues. These tools cannot always determine the intent of the PowerShell author, so they may draw attention to a suspicious script.
## Nivel 3

   - Threat hunting is the practice of proactively looking for cyber threats that are lurking undetected in a network. Cyber threat hunting digs deep to find malicious actors in your environment that have made it past the initial endpoint security defenses.
- [ ] **Physical security**:
   - Physical security is the protection of people, property, and physical assets from actions and events that could cause harm or loss. Although often overlooked in favor of cyber security, physical security is equally important.
- [ ] **Incident Response Management**:
   - Incident response is a structured process that organizations use to identify and handle cyber security incidents. The response includes several stages, including incident preparation, detection and analysis of a security incident, containment, eradication and full recovery, and post-incident analysis and learning.
- [ ] **Malware analysis**:
   - Malware analysis is the process of understanding the behavior and purpose of a suspicious file or URL. The output of the analysis helps in the detection and mitigation of the potential threat.
- [ ] **Software Application Security**:
   - Application security describes the application-level security measures that aim to prevent data or code within the application from being stolen or hacked. It covers security considerations that occur during application development and design, but also involves systems and approaches to securing applications after they are deployed.
- [ ] **Zero Trust architecture**:
   - Zero Trust is a network security model based on the philosophy that no person or device inside or outside an organization's network should be given access to connect to IT systems or services until they are authenticated and continuously verified.
- [ ] **Cloud Security**:
   - Cloud security, also known as cloud computing security, is a set of security measures designed to protect cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and data. These measures ensure user and device authentication, control access to data and resources, and protect data privacy. They also support regulatory data compliance.
- [ ] **Continuous Security - Automation and Monitoring**:
