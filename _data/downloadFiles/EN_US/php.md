# PHP
## Nivel 1
- [ ] **PHP - Fundamentals**:
   - PHP is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications.

   - Using conditional structures ('if', 'else')
   - Knowing the comparison operators
   - Using repetition structures and loops ('while', 'for')
   - Using functions, passing parameters and arguments
   - Manipulating methods
   - Manipulating arrays and lists
- [ ] **PHP - Collections**:
   - A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements. They are like containers that group multiple items into a single unit. Some collections allow duplication of elements and some do not. Some are ordered and some are unordered.
   - Learning the uses and differences between arrays, lists, stacks, hash maps, heaps
   - Working with Iterators, Generators and Collections
- [ ] **Object-oriented Programming Concepts**:
   - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
   - How objects work
   - Creating and using constructors

- [ ] **PHP - Persistence**:
   - The concept of "data persistence" refers to ensuring that the information inputted into an application will be stored in a medium where it can be retrieved consistently. In other words, they are permanent records that are not lost when the session is closed.
   - Knowing how to use PDO
   - Making insertions, changes and removals in a database
   - Creating queries on a database using filters
- [ ] **PHP - Files and Streams**:
   - Streams are the way of generalizing file, network, data compression, and other operations which share a common set of functions and uses. In its simplest definition, a stream is a resource object which exhibits streamable behavior. That is, it can be read from or written to in a linear fashion, and may be able to seek an arbitrary location within the stream.

   - In software engineering, a Design Pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.
